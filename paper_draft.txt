We woudl explain to them how to navigate the terminal first and explain the importance of the branches and merging what they ahev done into the main repository. We would also ecxplain how they need to commit, add, push, and pull the repository to make changes to it that will be saved to giuthub. They should only make changes to the code int heir own separate branch so that way someone else could potentially take the time to review their code to makae sure that their code will not cause any errors in the main code. the same process will also be applied to them working in the text file minus the person needing to take time to read what they wrote. Also by them doing work in their own branch that will later be added to the main code using the merge function will allow the roup to go back to the previous commit if the new persons code did infact mess uo the entire code making it easy to fix their mistakes without messing up the entire code.
